Image Processing and a bit of Machine Learning

Tha focus of the project is to create a way for people to know what is in their fridge and how much is left. As well as other important details. The system should be pretty robust and adapt based on users' needs, preferences, and habits.

SCRUM: 
1. Save pictures
2. Image Analysis
3. View Pictures
4. Fridge fullness/information Algorithm
5. Adjusting Algorithm Output(robust)

Layout
